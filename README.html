This my talk at the Perl Conference 3.0 in Monterey on Aug 24th, 1999.
Unfortunately the time of one hour turned out to be too short, so a
lot of things could not be discussed in depth. To balance the
shortcoming, I'm intending to improve the slides and add useful
ressources as time permits. Please send me your updates and
suggestions how to save the world.

BTW, the first slide is <a href="k01.html">k01.html</a>.

Enjoy,
